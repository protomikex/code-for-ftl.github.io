We had a huge turnout and the pizza flew out of the box. But we always think outside the box, right? This week was particularly exciting as this Saturday we are hosting the Miami Open Data Jam! This an event for everyone, coders and non-coders, to share their ideas on how we can make Open Data a standard in Miami-Dade County. Sign up and share your ideas with us!
We introduced some new Core Members of the Code for Miami Team. Danielle Ungermann is the new Community Organizer, keeping track of members and important dates as well as spreading the word of Code for Miami. Maggie Diaz-Vera will be our Storyteller, updating social networks and the Code for Miami blog with important/useful information and weekly updates. Xavier Hayeck and Antonio Llanos will act as the Delivery Leads. Xavier and Antonio will be the people to go to if you want to be assigned to or learn more about the projects going on at Code for Miami.
We had a special guest join us for last night’s meeting. <a href="https://waldo.jaquith.org/">Waldo Jaquith</a> from the <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/10/the-radical-new-institution-to-liberate-us-data/280988/">U.S. Open Data Institute</a> and creator of The <a href="http://www.statedecoded.com/">State Decoded</a> happened to be in Miami for a conference and decided to join us to see what we are doing to make Miami’s data more transparent. We want to thank him very much for sharing his ideas on how we can use the Local Business Tax Data, the XML file we’ve created from the <a href="https://www.municode.com/library/fl/miami/codes/code_of_ordinances">Municode</a> information, and general ideas on getting Miami-Dade’s data to be more open.</p>
<p>Some projects that are still in development are the Open 311 application, the Text My Bus App is currently in the testing stage, and we have been given a new project to develop in Rep Miami. Rep Miami is an application started by Patrick that will be developed for citizens to be able to easily get into contact with their local representatives.</p>
<p>A special thank to Wyncode as well as they filmed our meeting last night to be featured in a video highlighting the growth of technology in Miami and Wynwood and the launch of their new code school.</p>
<p>It looks like we will be amounting to some great things, and we thank you for contributing however you can. And as always we thank our fearless leaders, Rebekah and Ernie. With all the work we are doing, 2014 can certainly become the year for Open Data in Miami-Dade County! With that being said, come out to Open Data Jam for our Brainstorming session and share with all your friends who want to make a difference! Hope to see you all next week.</p></div></section></article></section><script src="/js/vendor/jquery.js"></script><script src="/js/vendor/modernizr.js"></script><script src="/js/foundation/foundation.js"></script><script src="/js/foundation/foundation.topbar.js"></script><script>$(document).foundation();</script></body></html>
